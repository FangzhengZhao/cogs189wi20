# EEG Assignment 2
## Assigned: Sunday 09 February 2020
## Due: Tuesday 18 February 2020 @ 11:59 PM PST

This assignment will focus primarily on training a classifier on competition data. A P300 speller dataset has been chosen since
the first BCI speller created followed a similar design (Farawell and Donchin, 1988) and it is an ideal candidate for demonstrating
the potential of a robust binary classifier, the linear discriminant analysis (LDA). 
<br><br>
In order to make the assignment more interactive, we've decided to use MATLAB Live Script which is similar to Jupyter Notebook.
Like the previous assignment, respond to answers on Gradescope as they are presented to you. However, this assignment
will also require you to change the values of various variables as they are presented to you. The modifications will always be
described. Please be careful to fill all of them out correctly as incorrect inputs may cause your answers to be incorrect.

For the first questions, you will be referring to the description of the dataset which can be found here: http://www.bbci.de/competition/ii/albany_desc/albany_desc_ii.pdf
